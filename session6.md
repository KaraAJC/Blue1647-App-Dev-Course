####Checklist for MVP:
[] - I have my Idea summarized in a readme
[] - I have a list of my audiences in a readme
[] - I have a list of features my app should provide the audiences I mentioned, in a readme
  -- Choose the top three features to focus on in this MVP by answering: "What makes this app unique, and is essential to this app functioning?"
[] - Stack:  I know what languages, libraries, and datasets I'm using to build my app. For the purposes of this program, Please use HTML/CSS/JS along with front-end frameworks Bootstrap, Materialize, or mobile framework Ionic to complete your app.
[] - Architecture:  I have, at minimum, the following files in a Github repository where i'm hosting my app:
-- index.html (the homepage of your site)
-- style.css (the style for your site)
-- custom.js (the interactive functionality of your site)
-- assets folder (where images, files, etc are stored)
[] - Architecture Cont: My index.html file is holding link tags to my CSS and JS files, as well as the Frameworks I'm using (CDNs of materialize/bootstrap, etc.)

##Homework:
